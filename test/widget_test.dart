// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:myapp/main.dart'; // Import your main app file

void main() {
  testWidgets('Speed Test App UI Test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const SpeedTestApp());

    // Verify that the 'Run Speed Test' button is present
    expect(find.text('Run Speed Test'), findsOneWidget);

    // Verify that the download speed is not displayed initially
    expect(find.textContaining('Download Speed:'), findsNothing);

    // Tap the 'Run Speed Test' button
    await tester.tap(find.text('Run Speed Test'));
    await tester.pump();

    // Note: The actual speed test functionality would require mocking
    // the network calls, which is beyond the scope of this basic test.

    // You could add more specific tests here based on your app's behavior
  });
